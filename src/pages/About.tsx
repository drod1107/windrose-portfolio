      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I build practical solutions that make a real impact. My work spans data analytics, cybersecurity, web development, and hands-on systems design. I thrive on complex challenges and bring a high-level, systems-oriented perspective to every project, but I know the details matter, and I never shy away from digging into them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently pursuing a computer science degree with a focus on AI, security, and modern development. My goal is to work at the intersection of AI, Big Data, and Cyber Security to help defend users against AI misalignment and AI-empowered threats. 
      </p> 
      <p>I believe in direct communication, critical thinking, and meaningful outcomes over hype. Whether it’s launching a new app, streamlining a process, or helping others gain access to technology, I’m here to create things that actually work and make life better.
